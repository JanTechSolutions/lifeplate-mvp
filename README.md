LifePlate MVP

Ditch the to-do list. Clear your plate.

LifePlate is a web-based life navigation app that helps users manage their day based on how they feel, how much time they have, and what truly matters to them.

Rather than treating productivity as a checkbox game, LifePlate embraces the full spectrum of your lived experience — work, wellness, relationships, finances, creativity, rest — and helps you harmonize your responsibilities in real-time.

🧠 How It Works

LifePlate uses mood-based filtering and contextual task matching to recommend tasks that align with your available time, current energy, and priorities.

💡 Key Features:

Engage: Quick onboarding quiz to determine your top priorities and balance needs.

Prompt: Personalized suggestions based on your user persona (Student, Caregiver, Professional, or Blank Plate).

Navigate: Add tasks with rich metadata like category, energy level, tags, time, location, and due date.

Clear: Suggest tasks that fit your current mood and available time.

Support: Mood check-ins, affirmation pairing, and visual task insights (coming soon).

❤️ Why LifePlate?

Because burnout isn’t productive.
Because context matters.
Because to-do lists don’t care how you feel — but LifePlate does.

“LifePlate listens first — to your time, your mood, and your needs — then suggests what’s actually doable.”
